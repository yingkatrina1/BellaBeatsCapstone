Merge daily_calories and daily_activity into cal_activity dataframe

cal_activity <- merge(daily_calories, daily_activity, by="Id")
> 
> View(cal_activity)
> colnames <- cal_activity
> colnames(cal_activity)
 [1] "Id"                       "ActivityDay"             
 [3] "Calories.x"               "ActivityDate"            
 [5] "TotalSteps"               "TotalDistance"           
 [7] "TrackerDistance"          "LoggedActivitiesDistance"
 [9] "VeryActiveDistance"       "ModeratelyActiveDistance"
[11] "LightActiveDistance"      "SedentaryActiveDistance" 
[13] "VeryActiveMinutes"        "FairlyActiveMinutes"     
[15] "LightlyActiveMinutes"     "SedentaryMinutes"        
[17] "Calories.y"              


Now make a visualization plot to see relationship between Calories and Total Steps


Then visualize

ggplot(cal_activity) +
  aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories.y) +
 geom_point()

> ggplot(cal_activity) +
+    aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories.y) +
+    geom_point()


From dataframe Sleep_Day, compare TotalMinutesAsleep to TotalTimeInBed (no need to merge data frames this time)

ggplot(sleep_day) +
 aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed) + geom_point()
